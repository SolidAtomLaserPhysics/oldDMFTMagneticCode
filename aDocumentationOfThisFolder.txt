This folder was used to do very little changes to Georgs Code (in old Fortran), to be clear: only the mistakes he found
Additionally the Sampling was improved by what we discussed in february (7.3.23)


run.sh runs this script with specific start values, for that it copies the hubb.andpar_bak to hubb.andpar to use it with those values, e.g. 36 processors
Then we get specific values of V and Epsilon to compare to other Code versions
for that we use symm = true, U = 2, mu = 1, 2D SC and so on


Dont have -g to not activate degug mode and then faster
use -O3 to be faster

start it with ./run.sh
